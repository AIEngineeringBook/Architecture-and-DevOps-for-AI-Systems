## AI Engineering
AI Engineering, or Software Engineering for AI, advances the development, deployment, and maintenance of AI-based systems throughout their entire lifecycle. It includes aligning system and software requirements with AI/ML modeling, optimizing data management to achieve business objectives, and designing architectures conducive to AI functionalities. This discipline merges AI with established software development practices, emphasizing the management of nonfunctional system attributes such as safety, reliability, and security, while fostering effective organizational collaboration and developing infrastructures essential for AI systems.
