    <p>AI-based systems present unique challenges that traditional software engineering strategies struggle to address. The autonomous nature of AI, coupled with its intrinsic uncertainty and opaque models, complicates the processes of verification, validation, and control. This often results in systems that are not only costly to deploy and operate but also prone to unintended consequences and value misalignment. "AI Engineering: Architecture and DevOps for AI Systems" emerges as a vital resource in this complex landscape, introducing an innovative discipline designed to navigate these challenges.</p>
    <p>AI Engineering diverges significantly from conventional software engineering. It grapples with the imprecision inherent in AI components, which are characterized by probabilistic correctness and require meticulous handling of training and testing data during quality assurance phases. This book delves into the DevOps strategies specifically tailored for AI systems, offering a comprehensive guide on how to architect, design, and develop these systems to ensure successful deployment, operation, and continuous monitoring.</p>
    <p>While MLOps shares a similar goal to DevOps, focusing on the narrower scope of ML models and components, it represents only a segment of the broader AI engineering framework. MLOps concentrates on managing machine learning processes, where control over training data is often direct and crucial. In contrast, this book advocates for a holistic approach to AI system management. It positions MLOps as a partial solution within the expansive realm of AI Engineering, emphasizing the need for integrated strategies that encompass the entire AI system lifecycle.</p>
